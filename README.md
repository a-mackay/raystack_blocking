# raystack_blocking

A Rust library providing a synchronous SkySpark client. This library is
a thin wrapper around the asynchronous [raystack](https://github.com/a-mackay/raystack) library.

This library exposes almost the same API as the underlying `raystack` library.

See the `examples/` folder for usage examples.
